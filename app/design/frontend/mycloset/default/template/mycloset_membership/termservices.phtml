<h2 style="text-align: center;">STORAGE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT</h2>
</div>
<p>This STORAGE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT (the &ldquo;<strong>Agreement</strong>&rdquo;), between you the customer (the &ldquo;<strong>Customer</strong>&rdquo;), and My Closet Concierge, LLC, a New York limited liability company (the &ldquo;<strong>Company</strong>&rdquo;), describes the terms and conditions applicable to the Services outlined below, and governs the relationship between Customer and Company. The Agreement is effective the earlier of the date Customer uses the Services rendered by Company or the date Customer clicks &ldquo;ACCEPT&rdquo; below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">RECITALS</h4>
<p>1. Company is in business of cataloging, transporting, and storing Items (as defined below), as more fully described in <strong>Section 3</strong> below (the &ldquo;<strong>Services</strong>&rdquo;); and</p>
<p>2. Customer wishes to engage Company to provide the Services with respect to garments and other articles of clothing, shoes and accessories (the &ldquo;<strong>Items</strong>&rdquo;) provided by Customer as may be amended from time to time in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below.</p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein and other good valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties do hereby agree as follows:</p>
<p>3. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of Services</span></strong>. Company agrees to provide the following services to Customer or on Customer&rsquo;s behalf:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(a) Company provides a storage service to Customer for the Items, based upon the amount of Items stored. Company will pick up and transport Items from a location designated by Customer to Company&rsquo;s premises (each such trip to pickup or drop-off Items an &ldquo;<strong>Appointment</strong>&rdquo;). Company highly recommends that every Item be professionally cleaned before Company takes possession of any Items or else requires that the Customer consent to Company arranging to have the Items cleaned by a third party prior to storing such Items in the Company&rsquo;s facility. Please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions section of the Company&rsquo;s website for more information on garment care and to <strong>Section 3(b)</strong> of this Agreement for further information about Company&rsquo;s policies regarding cleaning of Items.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(b) When Customer arranges for a pickup Appointment, Customer will list each of the Items to be picked up. Customer must separate clothing Items that have recently been laundered from the rest of the clothing Items. Customer will be deemed to have consented to have each unlaundered Item professionally laundered prior to storage. At Company&rsquo;s facility, Company will carefully inspect each Item upon receipt. If Company believes that any Items not designated to be professionally laundered nonetheless require laundering, or if Company discovers any damage to the Items such as stains, rips or other damages of any kind, Company will inform Customer of such Item&rsquo;s condition and may recommend cleaning or repair work to be performed on such Item. If Customer refuses to grant consent to clean or repair such Items that Company concludes to be in need of cleaning or repairs, Company may refuse to store the Item(s), in which case they will be returned to Customer at Customer&rsquo;s sole expense. Although Company does not perform any cleaning and/or repair services itself, Company shall use its best efforts to arrange for such services on behalf of Customer upon written consent of Customer. In the event Company arranges for such cleaning and/or repair services, additional fees will apply. In accordance with the terms of <strong>Section 13</strong> herein, Customer agrees and acknowledges that Company shall not be responsible for any loss or damages of any kind to Items in connection with the services performed by any third-party provider for cleaning and/or repairs. Customer further agrees and acknowledges that Company shall have the sole discretion to select the third-party provider for cleaning and/or repairs of Items on behalf of Customer, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Customer further agrees and acknowledges that Company shall not be responsible for oxidized stains or other marks on the Items which appeared once Company took possession of such Items.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(c) At Company&rsquo;s facility, Company will photograph and catalog Customer&rsquo;s Items that will be stored by Company, unless otherwise agreed. Such images will be available for online viewing via &ldquo;Virtual Closet,&rdquo; the Company&rsquo;s web-based cataloging service (&ldquo;<strong>Virtual Closet</strong>&rdquo;). The &ldquo;Stored Items&rdquo; page reflects the Items currently being stored by the Company (&ldquo;<strong>Stored Items</strong>&rdquo;), and will be solely available for online viewing via Virtual Closet. The Customer shall receive a notification from Company advising Customer that the Stored Items are available for online viewing via Virtual Closet. It is the sole responsibility of Customer to ensure that the Stored Items list accurately reflects the inventory of Items currently held by the Company. The Stored Items list will be deemed accurate and accepted by Customer unless Customer notifies Company of any required amendments within five (5) business days from the date of notification. All storage fees include unlimited access to Virtual Closet. In the event Customer does not store any Items at Company&rsquo;s facility, additional fees apply for the Virtual Closet service as indicated in <strong>Section 4(b)(1)</strong> below.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(d) Company has the sole discretion to decide the manner in which each Item is stored at Company&rsquo;s facility, and whether or not to accept each Item for storage at such facility. Customer hereby authorizes Company to take any action necessary to ensure that any Item belonging to Customer is stored safely and properly. With the exception of fur Items (see <strong>Section 4(a)(4)</strong> below), all other Items will be stored in the Company&rsquo;s secure facility, which is a temperature-controlled, air-purified space subject to ideal textile storage conditions as determined by Company.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(e) The Company will arrange for certain Items identified by Customer to be hand delivered to Customer or an Authorized Person (&ldquo;<strong>Requested Items</strong>&rdquo;) at a location within the Borough of Manhattan designated by Customer, or to other specified areas in New York City, and other areas in New York or New Jersey upon approval by Company. In the event Customer requests that certain Items be delivered outside the Borough of Manhattan, and Company agrees to make such drop-off, additional fees will apply. Although Company does not regularly provide transportation services outside the Borough of Manhattan, Company will arrange for the transportation of Items through a third party carrier, at Company&rsquo;s sole discretion. In accordance with the terms of <strong>Section 13</strong> herein, Customer agrees and acknowledges that Company shall not be responsible for any loss or damages of any kind to Items in connection with the services performed by any third-party carrier. Customer further agrees and acknowledges that Company shall have the sole discretion to select a third-party carrier for transportation of such Items outside the Borough of Manhattan unless otherwise agreed by Customer and Company. Upon written or web request via Virtual Closet to Company, Requested Items shall be ready to wear upon drop-off or delivery, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Additional charges will apply for special requests.</p>
<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fees for Services</strong></span>: Customer agrees to pay Company the following fees (plus applicable taxes) for Services provided on behalf of Customer in accordance with Company&rsquo;s schedule of fees below, subject to change from time to time in accordance with <strong>Section 16</strong> herein, as follows:</p>
<p>(a) <b>Storage Services</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(1) The Items listed in the Stored Items section of the Virtual Closet represent those items used to calculate Customer&rsquo;s monthly storage fees as further detailed in <strong>Section 4(a)(2)</strong> below.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(2) Each Customer that retains storage services under this <strong>Section 4(a)</strong> agrees to pay Company a base monthly minimum storage fee in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), regardless of the total number of Items such Customer actually stores at Company&rsquo;s facility. This minimum monthly storage fee entitles Customer to store a maximum of fifty (50) Items before incurring any additional charges. To store more than fifty (50) Items per month, an additional monthly fee of three dollars ($3.00) per each additional Item will apply. Customers are invoiced at the beginning of every month based on the number of Items listed on the Customer&rsquo;s Stored Items page. Any fur Items accepted for storage by Company under <strong>Section 4(a)(4)</strong> herein shall not be counted towards their total number of Stored Items and are billed separately.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(3) Storage of the Items involves pickup, inspection, cataloging, at least one photo of each Item, and the set up of Virtual Closet on a secure website accessible only by the Customer, as well as garment care supply rental, including but not limited to garment bags, archival boxes, shoe boxes, hangers, cedar, and acid-free tissue. Customer agrees to return all garment care supplies provided to Customer. In the event Customer fails to return such garment care supplies, Customer agrees to pay Company the fair market value for such supplies, as determined in the sole opinion of the Company. The first time that each specific Item is picked up in an Appointment, inspected, catalogued, photographed and the image uploaded to Customer&rsquo;s Virtual Closet, a one-time processing fee of three dollars ($3.00) per Item shall apply.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(4) Company will only accept Items made of fur for storage upon request by Customer and subsequent approval by Company. If Company grants permission for storage of fur Items, Company requires that such fur Items be stored only in cold storage. Company does not provide cold storage services at Company&rsquo;s facilities. Cold storage of fur Items shall take place at the facility of a third party selected solely by the Company. Company shall not charge any extra fees for storage of fur Items itself, but Customer will be responsible for paying any and all charges of the third-party cold storage facility when Customer is invoiced by the Company. In accordance with the terms of <strong>Section 13</strong> herein, Customer agrees and acknowledges that Company shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any kind to fur Items in connection with the services performed by any third-party cold storage facility.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(5) Customer shall pay an Appointment fee of forty dollars ($40.00) to the Company for each Appointment; including both Item pickup and drop-off. Please note however that depending on which membership option is selected by the Customer, Customer may be entitled to one complimentary Appointment per month.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(6) Customer must inform Company in advance when requesting storage of any Items that are of significant sentimental value to Customer, or any Items that require special instructions or requests with regard to the manner in which they are handled and stored. Company will consider such requests on a case-by-case basis, and storage of such Items will be at the sole discretion of Company. If Company elects to store such Items, additional charges may apply.</p>
<p>(b) <b>Non-Storage Services</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web-Based Cataloging Service: Virtual Closet</span>. Company will pick up, photograph and catalog Customer&rsquo;s Items at Company&rsquo;s facilities and will deliver such articles of clothing upon completion of same. For Customers that sign up for the storage services described in <strong>Section 4(a)</strong> above, there is no charge associated with the viewing of Customer&rsquo;s Items in Customer&rsquo;s Virtual Closet. Customers that sign up for Virtual Closet services <strong>only</strong> will be responsible for payment of a flat rate of ten dollars ($10.00) per article of clothing as a processing fee, plus a semi-annual Virtual Closet access and membership fee of two dollars ($2.00) per Item. The annual Virtual Closet access and membership fee applies to all non-storage services. Customer shall receive a notification from Company advising Customer that such articles of clothing are available for online viewing. Please note that the Web-based cataloging service or &ldquo;Virtual Closet Only&rdquo; membership option also involves a charge of forty dollars ($40.00) per Appointment, for both pickup and drop-off of such items.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At-Home Services</span>. In the event Customer requests that Company perform at-home services, such as closet consulting, closet organizing, cataloging, or packing, at Customer&rsquo;s office and/or residence, or other location designated by Customer, an hourly fee of one hundred dollars per person ($100.00) will apply.
